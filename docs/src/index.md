# AsteroidThermoPhysicalModels.jl

A Julia-based toolkit for thermophysical modeling (TPM) of asteroids. It allows you to simulate the temperature distribution of the asteroid and predict non-gravitational perturbations on its dynamics. Sample notebooks are available in [Astroshaper-examples](https://github.com/Astroshaper/Astroshaper-examples).

## TPM workflow
Coming soon.

## Surface/sub-surface temperature analysis
Coming soon.

## Non-Gravitational Effects

### Yarkovsky effect
Coming soon.

### YORP effect
Coming soon.
